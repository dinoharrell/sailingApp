a very simple Gemini AI (as available freely on 20251202) created webapp to display speed as last 10 second average and last 30 second average. Idea is to see how changes to sheeting, helm, heading, etc. affect sailboat speed. I'm an older (70) sailor, I don't see as well as I used to and wanted something that would give me feedback on sailing speed as I make changes to sheeting, helm position, heading, balance, etc. I've sailed thousands of hours and miles over the years and always wanted something like this. Instantaneous speed isn't terribly useful because gps fixes aren't precise enough at the slow speeds of small sailboats to be very accurate over a second, several seconds are needed to get good numbers. and the changes made while sailing might take several seconds to have their full impact. having multiple averages over different time intervals also helps gauge other factors affecting speed like changes in wind speed, wind direction, chop encountered, wakes, etc.
