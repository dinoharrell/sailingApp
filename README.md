Version 1. A very simple Gemini AI (as available freely on 20251202) created webapp to display device (eg. cell phone) speed as last 10 second average and last 30 second average. Purpose is to see how changes to sheeting, helm, heading, etc. affect sailboat speed. I'm an older (70) sailor, I don't see as well as I used to and wanted something that would give me easily visible feedback (aka large, bold) on sailing speed as I make changes to sheeting, helm position, heading, balance, etc. I've sailed thousands of hours and miles over the years and always wanted something like this. Speed as reported by many wonderfully useful apps like Google Maps isn't terribly useful when displayed so small on your phone you can't see it because you're near sighted and your reading glasses are stored safely down below and because gps fixes aren't precise enough at the slow speeds of sailboats to be very useful for calculating speed per second - several seconds are needed to get accurate numbers. Further, the changes made while sailing might take several seconds to have their full impact - heavy displacement sailboats have a lot of momentum relative to thrust. Having multiple averages over different time intervals also helps gauge other factors affecting speed like changes in wind speed (gusts), wind direction, chop encountered, wakes, etc.
